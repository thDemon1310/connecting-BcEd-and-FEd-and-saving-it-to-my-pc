# To connect backend and frontend and save file in my PC

## What I willing to do?
- To make backend and frontend
- In frontend I will allow user to select filename , fileType and content he want to save in it.
- I will then use **post** to send user input data to server(my laptop) and it will get saved into my desktop dir
